From 0 to Prediction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideias: 

1 - Collaboratively build a roadmap guiding the data analysis procedures and steps from zero to prediction.

2 - It should be like a checklist with the "best-practices" steps to be taken or no

3 - It should say 5W2H for each step (What to do, Why do it, When will do, Where, How, How much)

4 - For each step, suggest related tools, methods, lectures, researches, etc... that will help complete that step

Major Processes:
1 - Getting and Cleaning
2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
3 - Building Statistical Model
